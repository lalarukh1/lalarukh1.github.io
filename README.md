My personal portfolio site developed using Bulma!
<h1> Introduction </h1>
<p> This website is developed using Bulma, just plain Bulma! 
I started developing it to get an understanding of what Bulma is all about, 
it's different classes etc. And also to try designing a template that is different from the traditional one page web layouts. 
But as I continued learning, I got carried away and developed my whole porfolio website. I didnot have a portfolio on the web before, 
so i guess it all worked out good!
I have tried playing with different ready made components and classes of Bulma. I have also used Bulma-extensions in the form of Carousal 
that works with additional javascript. The only thing that bothered me was changing the color of progress bars, that could not be done in a 
sensible way at the moment.
As far as responsiveness is concerned, I have not written a single media query for this. I just had to use a few 
classes to fit some things and rest of the stuff already fit because of Bulma's mobile first approach.
There  are also two buttons on the side bar to switch to day/night mode. Day mode is more like grey scale and night is with colors. 
Overall, a really good experience.
